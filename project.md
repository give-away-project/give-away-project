User --> CR
Add --> CRUD


MVP:
- anyone can CUD adds
- to contact a user: we just display the email address
  <a href="mailto: xxx@xxxx.com">


To-do:
[ ] user model: use built in validators (required, unique)


Bonus:
- top priority: only the person that created an add can U+D.
- responsive
- uploading images (cloudinary)
- localization / maps
- contacting user through the app (ex. send email or send comments)
